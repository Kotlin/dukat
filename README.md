# Description
Converter of TypeScript definition files to Kotlin declarations

This requires JRE 1.6+ to run. It generates Kotlin files that are compatible with Kotlin 1.1+ (generated declarations
are tested against latest stable compiler version)

# How to install

The simplest way to use is install the latest version form [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dukat):
```shell
npm install -g dukat
```

# Usage

```shell
dukat [<options>] <d.ts files>
```

where possible options include:
```shell
    -p  <qualifiedPackageName>      package name for the generated file (by default filename.d.ts renamed to filename.d.kt)
    -m  String                      use this value as @file:JsModule annotation value whenever such annotation occurs
    -d  <path>                      destination directory for files with converted declarations (by default declarations are generated in current directory)
    -v, -version                    print version
```
